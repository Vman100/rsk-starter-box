# RSK Starter Box

## Description

This box comes with everything you need to start using smart contracts at RSK Network. It includes network configs for Mainnet and Testnet.

## Installation

First ensure you are in a new and empty directory and have truffle installed. 

If you don't have truffle installed you'll need to run this in order to install it.

```bash
npm install -g truffle
```

### Unboxing

Run the unbox command

```bash
truffle unbox rsksmart/rsk-starter-box
```

## Setup environment

The only thing you'll need to do it's to copy your mnemonic to truffle-config.js

```js
// truffle-config.json

const HDWalletProvider = require('@truffle/hdwallet-provider');

//Put your mnemonic here, take care of this and don't deploy your mnemonic into production!
const mnemonic = 'A_MNEMONIC';
```

## Using the truffle console

You can start a truffle console for any RSK network

```bash
# Console for Mainnet
truffle console --network mainnet

# Console forn Testnet
truffle console --network testnet
```

## Migrating contracts
